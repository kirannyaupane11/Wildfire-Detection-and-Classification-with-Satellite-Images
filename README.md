#  Wildfire Detection and Classification using Satellite Images with AI

##  Project Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-based solution for **early detection and classification of wildfires** using satellite images. Wildfires are a growing threat globally, causing irreversible environmental damage, economic loss, and human displacement. Detecting them early can significantly reduce their devastating impact.

By training a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model using labeled satellite images, this system can automatically classify whether a given image shows signs of wildfire or not. This project is part of the academic course *Discipline-Specific AI Project*.

##  Problem Statement

Wildfires spread rapidly and are often detected too late. Traditional detection methods (like human monitoring or manual interpretation of images) are time-consuming and inefficient.

> **Goal:** Build an AI model that can accurately classify satellite images into two categories:  
> - `Wildfire`  
> - `No Wildfire`

##  Objectives

- Collect and preprocess satellite images of wildfire-affected and unaffected regions.
- Train a deep learning model (ResNet50-based CNN) for binary classification.
- Evaluate and validate the model.
- Deploy the model for real-time wildfire detection and future scalability.
